# JIL

JVM Interop Language (JIL) is an interpreted language of questionable quality I wrote to test interop between a language and the JVM

## Installation

If there are no releases, you'll have to clone and compile the repo yourself

If there are releases, just download the most recent one, then you can run one of the examples with `java -jar JIL.jar [file]`
